<title>The Odin Project-Web Development 101</title>

    Project 1:
For this project we are required to build a non-functioning replica of the google homepage to practice our skills in HTML, and CSS; as well as working with Git, and Github.

    To Future me:
At this point (Sept. 2020), I have started using codeCademy, and The Odin Project(TOP) to supplement freeCodeCamp in my learning to code.
I have made it through the responsive web design certificate a couppl of years ago on fCC, but quit coding shortly after completing.  After starting back up I completed Javascript up until the algorithms, which I am trying to get better at.  I will go back through the html and css to see what stuck from before. Learning about Git, Gitbash, command line, and open source has given me some confidence in my learning abilities, and  has been exciting.  Although I am not too good with command line yet, and have not worked on anyone elses projects, just my own, I am excited, and eager to get past that next step.
